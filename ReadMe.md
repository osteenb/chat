Python Multi-Client Chat Application
Author: Brooks O’Steen
Files: chat_server.py and chat_client.py
Language: Python 3

Purpose: Demonstrate a threaded TCP chat server and client capable of handling multiple users concurrently, complete with timestamps, usernames, and join/leave notifications.

 Overview
This project implements a multi-client chat system using Python sockets and threads.
It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server, exchange messages in real-time, and see who’s online.
Each message is timestamped and labeled with the sender’s username for clarity.
Key Features
•	Multi-user concurrent chat using threads.
•	Timestamps on all messages.
•	Usernames displayed with each message.
•	Join/Leave notifications for all participants.
•	 Broadcast messaging to all connected clients (except the sender).
•	 Custom commands:
•	/quit — safely disconnect from the chat.
•	/whosonline — see a live list of connected users.

 How It Works
Open separate Terminals and run python scripts in same folder as files.
Example PS C:\Users\brook\GitHubChatSRVR\chatserver> python chat_server.py
1. chat_server.py
The server:
•	Listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) at port 5000.
•	Accepts incoming TCP client connections.
•	Spawns a dedicated thread (handle_client) for each connected client.
•	Tracks connected clients in a shared dictionary:
clients = {socket: username} 
•	Each message is prefixed with:
•	[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] username: message
•	Broadcasts messages to all other users.
•	Handles disconnects gracefully and notifies others when a user leaves.

2. chat_client.py
The client:
•	Connects to the server’s IP and port.
•	Prompts for a username upon connection.
•	Launches a background thread (receive_messages) to continuously listen for new messages.
•	Runs a main send loop allowing the user to type and send messages.
•	Displays all messages from other users, complete with timestamps and usernames.
•	Supports /quit to exit cleanly.

 Example Usage
Start the Server
python chat_server.py 
Console output:
Starting chat server on 0.0.0.0:5000 ...
Server is running. Waiting for connections...
Start Clients
python chat_client.py 
Each user will see:

Data Flow Summary
[Client1] ----\
[Client2] -----\               ┌───────────────────────────┐
[Client3] -------> (Server) --->│ handle_client(threaded)  │
[Client4] -----/                │ broadcast() → all clients │
[Client5] ----/                 └───────────────────────────┘
Each client both sends and receives simultaneously through threads:
•	The main loop handles sending user input.
•	The background thread handles receiving and displaying messages.
________________________________________
Possible Enhancements
•	Add private messaging (/pm username message).
•	Add message history.
•	Implement GUI .
•	Add encryption (SSL/TLS or Fernet) for secure chat.
•	Display user join/leave notifications in a different color (with ANSI codes).

 Requirements
•	Python 3.8+
•	Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
•	No external libraries required — uses standard socket, threading, datetime, and sys.
